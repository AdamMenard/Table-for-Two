In contrast, we wanted to create a casual place with an emphasis on simple, delicious Italian food, drawing inspiration from all the regions of Italy. On one of our trips to Italy, we had lunch at a small trattoria in a town on the Ligurian coast. The place had been there for a long time and had become an institution with the locals. Furnished with small tables side-by-side, this trattoria gave us the inspiration for the type of place we wanted to create. A place with high energy and a convivial atmosphere, where our guests could come often for a satisfying meal. We created barbacco as a modern trattoria, reflecting a part of San Franciscoâ€™s city life, a casual dining experience that still delivers quality food and wine and attentive, personable service. Come join us and experience what inspired us.");
